# About program
# In this project, a main program and some functions are given, but you need to 
# implement three classes used by the main program: Card(), Deck(), and PlayingHand(). 
# Each card has two primary attributes: rank and suit. In a deck, 
# there are four suits -- hearts, spades, diamonds, and clubs --, 
# that we represent by their first letters: H(h), S(s), D(d), C(c). 
# Each suit has thirteen cards -- Ace, 2-10, Jack, Queen, and King â€“ with ranks 1-13 in that order. 
# Thus, a deck has 52 cards. A playing hand has thirteen cards.
